"""
This script facilitates the deployment and interaction with an Azure AI Agent for MiHCM's HR system. It uses the Azure AI Projects SDK to create and manage an AI agent that integrates with MiHCM's external APIs via OpenAPI specifications.

Key functionalities:
- Loads environment variables from a `.env` file for configuration.
- Creates an Azure AI Project client using a connection string and Azure credentials.
- Fetches the OpenAPI specification from a URL or local file to define API interactions.
- Initializes an AI agent with specific instructions and tools for interacting with MiHCM's HR APIs.
- Processes a user request (e.g., checking leave balances and submitting HR requests) using the AI agent.
- Logs the interaction and cleans up resources after execution.

Dependencies:
- Azure SDKs (`azure-identity`, `azure-ai-projects`)
- Python libraries (`dotenv`, `requests`, `jsonref`)

Environment Variables:
- `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for the Azure AI Project.
- `PROJECT_OPENAPI_CONNECTION_NAME`: Name of the OpenAPI connection for the project.

Usage:
1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Configure the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
3. Run the script to deploy the AI agent and process user requests.

You must get the categories and identify the correct category id for the work item.
For reach hr requests feedback types should be obtained and mapped using the feedbackTypeId.
When providing the responses related to reach hr requests you MUST provide the feedback name. 
For leave allocations leave type names should be obtained and mapped using the ONLY leaveTypeCode.
When providing the responses related to leave you MUST provide the leave type name without any sort of modification.
